# 🧬 Breast Cancer Survival Prediction (METABRIC Dataset)

## 📌 Overview  
This project predicts **5-year and 10-year overall survival** in breast cancer patients using the **METABRIC** dataset.  
It was developed as part of my Machine Learning coursework for the MSc in Digital Health & Data Science.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Build reliable ML models for survival prediction  
- Identify clinical features strongly associated with mortality  
- Compare ML model performance  
- Provide insights relevant for oncology decision support

## 🧠 Methods  
### Models Used  
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest  
- XGBoost

### Feature Engineering  
- Handling missing values  
- Standard scaling  
- Encoding clinical variables  
- Outlier handling  

### Evaluation Metrics  
- Accuracy  
- Precision/Recall  
- F1-score  
- Confusion Matrix  

**Best Model:** Random Forest  
**Best F1-score:** 0.71
